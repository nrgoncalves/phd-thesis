\def\baselinestretch{1.66}

Discussion goes here. A few topics that I must not forget to discuss:
\begin{itemize}
\item what may be the role of cortical organization: it exists (ocular dominance, orientation, disparity, motion, etc), but why is it there?
\item what are the main issues left to be explained in stereopsis?
\end{itemize}
