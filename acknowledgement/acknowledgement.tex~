  The projects that form the basis of this thesis would not have been possible without the help of many. I would like to acknowledge them here. 

  Thanks to Rosa Panchuelo, Susan Francis, and especially Denis Schluppeck for support with ultra-high field imaging at the University of Nottingham. Thank you also for your patience towards an overexcited first year graduate student.

  I would also like to thank Jan Zimmermann, Valentin Kemper and Rainer Goebel for their help with ultra-high field imaging at the University of Maastricht. Thanks to Jan and Valentin too for caring deeply about the preparations for the experiments.

  Thanks to my colleagues in the laboratory --- they have all helped at some point. I am particularly grateful to Hiroshi Ban for his help during the first few months in the job; I learned a lot. To my colleague Caro Luft, now a lecturer at Queen Mary, University of London: thank you for looking after me.

  I am extremely thankful to Andrew Welchman and Zoe Kourtzi for their advisory role, but also for the endless amount of opportunities and resources that they have always made available to me. I would also like to thank Ed Lalor, now an Associate Professor at the University of Rochester, for his support when I was a postgraduate student at Trinity College Dublin --- my time in Ed's lab was a great experience and the springboard to an exciting doctoral degree.
  
  I would like to thank the European Commission for funding my doctorate (FP7, Adaptive Brain Computations Initial Training Network) and the Erasmus Mundus programme that prepared me for this degree.

  Most of all, I would like to thank my family --- including my parents and my sister --- for uninterrupted support and reassurance. To my wife Ksenia and my son Ivan: thanks for being part of this journey. This book is dedicated to you.
